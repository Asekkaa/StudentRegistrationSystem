# StudentRegistrationSystem

In this project, I made a program where students can register to the system, track payments and view data. 

It was a program similar to the system called BUOBS used at Ba≈ükent University.

I used Microsoft SQL Server as database.

First of all, we are greeted with a username and password screen for logging into the system. 

The data we will enter here must be pre-registered in the database. 

Then we can register student, instructor, payment and new admin to the system via the software. 

In addition to these. We can view the data registered in the database in the form of a table and, if we want, we can print out in the form of an excel file.

I used the IDE named Visual Studio while designing the software. 

I made all my designs using Windows Form Application and MaterialSkin Framework. Thus, I could easily make my interface designs.

Coming to the database topic, I preferred Microsoft SQL Server because I wanted to create a local database. I created my necessary tables and added some data. 

You can also access the codes containing the connection with the database from the file called connection.cs.
